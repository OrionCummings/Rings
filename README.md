## Ring Types

The standard ring which does not grant the wearer any effects. An intermediate crafting ingredient for all types of rings.

## Ring of Swiftness

## Ring of Haste
Increases mining speed of wearer

## Ring Pouch
Holding all of your rings in your hotbar is quite difficult, especially when you only have two big fingers. The Ring Pouch addresses this issue, giving the player more space to hold rings without losing any utility.

## Items
### Common Gems
##### The three common gems are ruby, peridot, and azurite. Found anywhere below sea level in the overworld, these common gems offer the player a way to get started with rings without giving too much. These gems are too weak to be used in powerful rings but they still provide utility to those with enough of them.

### Rare Gems
#### Alexandrite
##### This pearlescent gem is exceedingly rare, but can be crafted into Mythic rings which hold enormous power.

### Forbidden Gems
##### Not much is known about these gems save for their incredible power. No one even remembers the names of these most dangerous gemstones, only that there exists two types. There are ancient tales of those who tried to contain their power through the art of rings but they all end in failure. Nobody has seen a forbidden gem in ages and people seem to think they are fading into obscurity...
